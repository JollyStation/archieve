# Berry "Physics" Ruin

Map by CRITAWAKETS

The Berry "Physics" Ruin was an in-character gag joke with Dendy/Dreary Doom. They claimed they got their degree
through the means of "Berry Physics".

The map itself features a berry-shaped area with berry seeds inside. And a protolathe board.

Relevant code needed to run this ruin properly has been provided.
