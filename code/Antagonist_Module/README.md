# Antagonist Module

This is the old Antagonist Module as of 2/17/2023.
All modular and non-modular code was removed in the following PR: https://github.com/TaleStation/TaleStation/pull/4599

What this version of the Antagonist Module held was Ambitious Traitor, Malf AI, Changeling, Heretic, Wizard, Cult and Clock Cult.
Players could craft a story, select their TC, be a neutered ling and so on.
There were options to choose from, but ultimately, all the code went unmaintained as well as going unused.

Due to the new direction of TaleStation, its removal is required.
