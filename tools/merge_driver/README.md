# Merge Driver

The merge driver was a bash script coded by MrMelbert.
The purpose of the merge driver was to streamline upstream merges back when JollyStation was a privately hosted server for the /TG/ Manuel crowd.
It was useful and rather robust, automatically accepting incoming merge conflicts, updating the .dme (if the option was chosen) as well as ignoring files
with the tag of `// NON-MODULAR COMMENT`. 

However, due to the nature of JollyStation now, the merge driver servered its purpose and is now retired. Due to the mirror bot, the merge driver is a relic of
a previous time before it existance.

The command used to run the driver was `./_merge_driver.bash`
